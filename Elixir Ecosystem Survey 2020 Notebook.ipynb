    "## About the Survey\n",
    "\n",
    "The survey was conducted over the course of the summer in 2020 by Brian Cardarella, who led the efforts to create and dissemniate the [survey](https://elixirforum.com/t/2020-elixir-ecosystem-survey/32396). The results of the survey were presented at [ElixirConf 2020](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=-nVgAcy9wB0) by Brian. \n",
    "\n",
    "The survey was created on Typeform, but has since been taken down. Hugo kindly extracted the data and also created a PSQL dump of the normalized data. For this analysis, only the raw data extract was used."
